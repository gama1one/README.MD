<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>We love doughnuts! At the Doughnut Shop we enjoy eating and baking doughnuts. And we are confident that you will love eating our doughnuts as much as we love baking and eating them too. Doughnuts are our passion. Our sole focus is to make the best doughnuts we can make for our clients. What does this mean? It means that we will never do anything that will distract us from our passions. At the Doughnut Shop we only bake doughnuts. We do not sell sandwiches, cookies, or salads. Aside from the requisite coffee or tea, we only sell doughnuts.</p>
